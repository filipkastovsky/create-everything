# create-everything
This is a TS create-everything template created by create-everything (yes, that can be done :))

* Add all your templates to the `templates` directory, these can be later accessed through the cli
* Feel free to explore and edit the template generator to your liking, basic config can be done through GLOBALS.js, but the entire codebase is to be tweaked to your liking
* When you're done, publish your package to `npm`
* `npx` like hell from your freshly created create- app, by default this can be done via `npx <your-package-name> <target-directory> <template-name>`
* **PROFIT**
