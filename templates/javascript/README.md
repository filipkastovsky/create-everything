# create-everything

This is a JS create-everything template created by create-everything (yes, that can be done :))

-   Add all your templates to the `templates` directory, these can be later accessed through the cli
-   Feel free to explore and edit the template generator to your liking
-   When you're done, publish your package to `npm`
-   `npx` like hell from your freshly created create- app, by default this can be done via `npx <your-package-name> <target-directory> <template-name>`
-   **PROFIT**
